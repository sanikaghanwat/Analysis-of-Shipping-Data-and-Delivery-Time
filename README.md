# Analysis-of-Shipping-Data-and-Delivery-Time


Problem statement: -
Develop a interactive dashboard to share insights of shipping data and build a machine learning model to predict whether a parcel will Reached on time or not.

Key Responsibilities: -
•	Data collection: Relevant data from Kaggle Website was gathered.
•	Data Preprocessing: The categorical variables were Encoded and feature scaling was performed.
•	Feature Extraction: Required features were extracted.
•	Exploratory Data Analysis: EDA was performed to uncover key patterns and correlations
•	Data Modeling: Multiple machine learning models were built and evaluated. 68% accuracy was achieved for SVM model.
•	Data Evaluation: Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation was implemented to optimize model performance.
•	Model performance was Analysed using metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC curve.
•	Power Bi Dashboard: An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize key metrics and trends, providing stakeholders with actionable insights.
  Actionable insights and recommendations were provided to enhance shipping processes and reduce delivery delays.
•	Tools and Technologies:
•	Programming Languages: Python
•	Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
•	Visualization Tools: Power BI
•	Techniques: Feature Engineering, Hyperparameter Tuning, Cross-Validation
